# Pomodoro-Timer
Pomodoro-Timer with a twist! The timer that counts UP and not down. Having a counter that counts down may tend
Having a counter that counts down may tend to cause stress; instead try having a counter that counts up! Now you are aware of 
the time and not set on a deadline. This app provides you with 25 minutes of dedicated focus, instead of the impending feeling 
of a time limit. If you have anxiety or become stressed when time is running out, this “stopwatch” will feel way better. 
Give it a try!
