# Pomodoro-Timer
Life-Hack!
Pomodoro-Timer with a twist, that times UP and not down. Having a counter that counts down may tend to stress you out, instead have a counter that counts up, so you are now aware of the time and not on a deadline. This feels more like a stopwatch giving yourself 25 minutes of working so you know how long you have been doing something instead of the feeling of a deadline. If you have anxiety or get stressed out impending deadlines, this will feel way better. Please give it a try!
